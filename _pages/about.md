Social learning is learning from others. The larger phenomenon of culture is identified when a group or population shares a behaviour because it is transmitted between individuals through social learning. Thus, social learning is necessary for culture, but does not equate to it.

Just a few decades ago, culture was said to be uniquely human, but that assumption was progressively eroded in the twentieth century, with the present century seeing an explosion of research on the topic. A burgeoning literature has revealed social learning and culture in a diversity of birds, mammals, reptiles, fish and insects, spanning a host of types of behaviour. Examples are emerging across a growing variety of behavioural domains including foraging techniques, migratory patterns, tool use, mate choice, vocal repertoires, breeding site preferences, nest making and courtship overtures. Our evolutionary perspectives on behaviour are hence accommodating to the many implications of the discovery of this pervasive ‘second inheritance system’ in many animals’ lives. 

In London in 2015, a first Joint Winter Conference of ASAB and PSGB on the topic of Social Learning and Culture proved highly popular and was judged a great success. Since then, the topic has continued to accelerate in the quality and reach of its findings, accompanied by a recognition of their potential in supporting conservation efforts and animal welfare. We judged the time is ripe for a further joint conference, covering the latest research efforts so active in both societies.
