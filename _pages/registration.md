## Registration and abstract submission will open on July 1st, 2026. ##

Both conference registration  and abstract submission will open on the 1st of July. Abstract submission will close on the 15th of August. Registration will close when the venue capacity is reached.

The conference venue has limited capacity so early registration will be essential. If you register to attend in person but later fail to attend without cancelling, you may be excluded from the next round of ASAB grants. We will contact all registered attendees in advance of the meeting to confirm planned attendance. 

It will be possible to register for all three days of the meeting (this is recommended) or for the ASAB days or PSGB day alone. Note that a registration fee will be required to attend the PSGB conference day on the 10th of December.

You can also attend the conference virtually, and we encourage anyone interested in hosting a local
