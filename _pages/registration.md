## Registration and abstract submission is now closed as we have reached the venue's capacity. We will email registrants in due course to re-confirm their in-person attendance. After this there may be more space for further registrations.

Registration and attendance is free of charge, but the venue has a limited capacity of 300, so it is essential that you register if you plan to attend in person. Note that you can also attend virtually and at 'hublets'.
