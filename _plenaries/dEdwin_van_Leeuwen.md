**Edwin van Leeuwen** is an Assistant Professor at Utrecht University. His research aims to chart and understand intraspecific variation in the social structures of primates' group life. Specifically, he studies cultural differences in great apes' sociality, and their impact on expressions of behaviour that bear relevance to survival and ultimately fitness (like cooperation and social learning).
